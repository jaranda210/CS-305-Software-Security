# CS-305-Software-Security

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
  Artemis Financial, a prominent investment firm, approached us with a pressing issue related to data security and integrity.  The company sought to enhance the security of their client data, ensuring that all information transmitted and stored within their systems was protected against     unauthorized access and tampering.  Specifically, Artemis Financial required a robust solution that would allow them to verify the integrity of their data through the implementation of cryptographic checksum functionalities.  This need arose from the increasing regulatory demands and the   company's commitment to maintaining the highest standards of data protection for their clients. Our task was to develop a software solution that integrated seamlessly with their existing infrastructure, providing a reliable means to calculate and verify checksums for critical data.  This   solution was essential to fortify their data security measures and ensure compliance with industry standards.
  
2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?  
  When identifying Artemis Financial's software security vulnerabilities, we conducted a comprehensive security audit, including vulnerability scanning, code reviews, and penetration testing.  We effectively communicated the findings and remediation steps to the client.  Secure coding is crucial as it protects sensitive data, ensures regulatory compliance, and prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.  It adds significant value to a company's overall well-being by enhancing reputation, increasing customer confidence, and mitigating the risk of data breaches and legal issues, thereby safeguarding financial health and operational stability.
  
3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was conducting thorough penetration testing, which required a deep understanding of the system and thinking like an attacker.  This phase was crucial for identifying potential exploit paths and prioritizing critical issues.  The code review process was particularly helpful, allowing us to identify and fix security flaws early, ensuring adherence to secure coding practices and mitigating common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).  These activities enhanced our understanding of Artemis Financial's software security posture and reinforced the importance of secure coding practices.
  
4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  To increase layers of security, I implemented encryption for data, multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts, and regular security training to raise awareness.  These actions helped to secure sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.  In the future, I would use automated tools like SAST (e.g., SonarQube) and DAST (e.g., OWASP ZAP), along with penetration testing, to identify vulnerabilities.  Mitigation techniques would be selected based on a risk assessment, prioritizing high-risk vulnerabilities to reduce the potential impact on the business.  These steps help protect assets, ensure customer trust, and comply with security regulations.
  
5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  To ensure the code was secure and functional, I used static analysis tools like OWASP Dependency-Check to identify vulnerabilities and conducted manual testing to verify functionality.  After refactoring, I ran penetration tests and reviewed security logs to check for any new vulnerabilities.  These steps, including using automated and manual testing, helped confirm the application met security protocols.
  
6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  For this project, I used tools like OWASP Dependency-Check for static code analysis, Spring Boot for secure app configuration, and Java Keytool for creating certificates.  Postman and curl were helpful for testing security features, and JUnit ensured that refactored code remained functional.  These resources and secure coding practices, such as input validation and encryption, will be crucial in future tasks to maintain security and prevent vulnerabilities.

7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  For future employers, I would showcase my work on this assignment by highlighting my ability to secure software applications through encryption and secure protocols.  I implemented a cipher algorithm to protect data, generated self-signed certificates for secure communication, and added a checksum verification to ensure data integrity.  Additionally, I refactored the code to ensure the application utilized HTTPS for secure transmission.  I also performed static analysis with OWASP Dependency-Check and thorough functional testing to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.  This demonstrates my expertise in secure coding practices, data protection, and vulnerability management, essential skills for ensuring both security and functionality in software development.
